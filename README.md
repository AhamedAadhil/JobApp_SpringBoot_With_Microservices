This Repository is all about Microservice Architecture. This is a Job Seeking application where there are 3 individual Microservices are running such as Comapny, Job and Review. 
For the inter-Service Communication, I have used RestTemplate Method. which is not that much of recommanded, but for the learning purpos I have used that in this Repository.
In future(upcomming repos) I will change it to any ServiceRegistry method to allow MicroServices to interconnect.
